Here is a short and straightforward description of Google Voice extensions:

Google Voice extensions allow you to set up a virtual phone system with multiple extensions mapped to individual team members' phone numbers. When a caller dials your main Google Voice number, they can select an extension from the auto-attendant menu to be routed directly to the corresponding team member's phone.

The key points about Google Voice extensions are:

- Create virtual extensions (e.g. press 1 for sales, 2 for support, etc.)
- Map each extension to ring an individual team member's phone number
- Caller can directly reach the desired person by selecting their extension
- Provides a professional phone menu system for your business
- Part of the paid Google Voice for Google Workspace plans, not the free consumer version

So in essence, Google Voice extensions turn your single virtual Google Voice number into a multi-line phone system with customizable call routing and an auto-attendant menu, without needing physical phone lines for each employee. This gives businesses a professional virtual PBX-like experience.
